File Modification Rule (CRITICAL):
- Multi-line Regex for search-and-replace in code is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. It is too brittle.
- When patching, use exact string replacement or rewrite the entire file.
- YOU MUST OUTPUT A STANDALONE \`patch.mjs\` SCRIPT containing the Node.js code to apply these changes (using the \`fs\` module).
- Do not just output the raw code blocks. Act strictly as a script-generator for patches.
